# Chocolate Sandwiches

## Ingredients:

- 1 3/4 all-purpose flour
	- Plus more for working surface
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 12 oz. white *or* dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

## Directions:

1. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Set aside.
2. Put butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer until creamy. Stir in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined.
3. Halve dough, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate about 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Roll dough on a lightly floured to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Space 1 inch apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate 30 minutes. 
5. Wrap scraps in plastic, and refrigerate 30 minutes; re-roll and cut.
6. Bake until edges just begin to brown, about 12 minutes. Cool sheets on wire racks.
7. Put 9 ounces of chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring cream to boil. Pour over chocolate; let stand 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Chill until spreadable, about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
8. Spread onto bottom of half the cookies. Sandwich with remaining cookies.
9. Melt remaining chocolate in a small heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Fill a parchment paper one, or a small pastry bag fitted with a round tip. With melted chocolate, decorate cookies.
