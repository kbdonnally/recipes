# Crepes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup flour
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 3/4 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Directions

1. Mix all ingredients together with a wire whisk until the consistency of heavy cream.
2. Some people put the crepe batter into the fridge to get all the little bubbles out, but it's totally not necessary if you're a normal person (paraphrasing!).
3. Run your whisk through the mixture slowly to break up the tiny bubbles.
4. Put pan on medium heat and brush with butter or spray with Pam. Pour in 1/3 cup batter.
5. Swirl the batter so it completely coats the bottom of the pan and put it back onto medium heat. Once the top looks dry, then slip a spatula underneath and flip the crepe over. It's much easier than you might think.
6. Look at the cooked side. Is it pale, or does it show brown circles where the batter began cooking at you poured in the batter?You want it to show the brown circles. If it's only pale, you might need to either increase your heat or leave the crepe slightly longer before you flip it over.
7. (The color does't really affect the flavor, of course, but it does make for improved texture, and it looks so delicious when they have those browned markings.)
8. Enjoy!
