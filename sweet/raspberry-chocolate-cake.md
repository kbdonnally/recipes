## Ingredients:

### Raspberry Filling:

- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp water
- 2 cups raspberries

### Chocolate Cake:

- 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
- 2 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup hot water

### Chocolate Frosting:

- 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, room temperature
- 12 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted
- 5 tbsp Hershey's dark cocoa powder
- 6 cups powdered sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 10-12 tbsp heavy whipping cream

### Chocolate Ganache:

- 9 oz (1 1/2 cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

## Directions:

### Raspberry Filling:

1. Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and water in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat and stir to combine. Heat until the mixture is wet and the sugar begins to melt.
2. Add the raspberries and stir to coat with the sugar mixture.
3. Continue to cook until the raspberries start to soften and let out juice. Use your spatula to mash the raspberries.
4. Remove from heat when raspberry juice has begun to thicken, after about 5 minutes. Pour the mixture in another bowl and refrigerate until cool.

### Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare three 8-inch cake pans with nonstick baking spray and parchment paper at the bottom.
2. Add the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a large mixer bowl and combine. Set aside.
3. Add the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and eggs to a medium size bowl and combine.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat until well-combined.
5. Slowly add the hot water to the batter and mix on low speed until well-combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well-combined.
6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.
7. Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for 2-3 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack to finish cooling.

### Chocolate Frosting:

1. Add butter to large mixer bowl and beat until smooth.
2. Add melted chocolate and mix until well-combined.
3. Add the cocoa powder and mix until well-combined.
4. Add about half of the powdered sugar, salt and half of the heavy cream and mix until well-combined.
5. Add the remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
6. Add the remaining heavy cream as needed to get the right consistency of frosting.

### Ganache:

1. To make ganache, add the chocolate chips to a medium size bowl.
2. Heat the heavy whipping cream in the microwage until it just begins to boil. Keep an eye on it because it happens quickly.
3. Pour hot cream over the chocolate chips and let sit for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Set aside.

### Making the Cake:

1. To layer the cake, first use a large serrated knife to remove domes from tops of the cakes so that they are flat. See [author's] tips on [how to level a cake](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/how-to-level-and-torte-a-cake/) and [how to stack a cake](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/how-to-fill-and-stack-a-layer-cake/). *(Note: very helpful!)*
2. Place the first cake layer on a serving plate or on a cardboard cake circle.
3. Pipe a dam around the outside of the cake layer with some of the chocolate frosting.
4. Spread about 1/4 cup of chocolate ganache on top of the cake layer, in the center of the dam.
5. Drop spoonfuls of the raspberry filling (use about half of the raspberry filling per layer) over the chocolate ganache and then spread into an even layer.
6. Add the second layer of cake, then repeat steps 3-5.
7. Add the third and final layer of cake on top.
8. Frost the top and outside of cake with the remaining chocolate frosting.
9. Use remaining chocolate ganache to drizzle chocolate around the edges of the cake, then fill in the center. If the ganache has gotten a little firm from sitting, just reheat for a few seconds until pourable again. See my tips on making a [chocolate drip cake](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/how-to-make-a-chocolate-drip-cake/).
10. Pipe swirls with remaining chocolate frosting around the top of the cake, then decorate with additional raspberries and chocolate sprinkles, if desired.

Refrigerate cake unitl ready to serve. Best when served at room temperature, and holds up well for 4-5 days when sealed in an airtight container.
