# Chia Seed Pudding

## Ingredients:

- 2 overripe large bananas
- 2 cups unsweetened coconut (or almond, or cashew) milk
- 6 tablespoons chia seeds
- 2-4 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

*Optional: garnishes*
- Toasted coconut flakes
- Banana slices
- Cacao nibs or shaved dark chocolate

## Directions:

1. In medium bowl, smash bananas well.
2. Add non-dairy milk and chia seeds; stir well.
3. Let sit for 30 or so minutes. Stir well, and repeat if needed, so recipe doesn't end up soupy.
4. Cover and place in refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight.
5. Serve with sliced bananas, toasted coconut flakes, shaved chocolate, or a dollop of coconut whipped cream.
