# Martha Stewart's Ultimate Chocolate Cake

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup cocoa, & more for dusting
- 3/4 cup strong coffee, boiling
- 1 cup milk, room temperature
- 2 3/4 cups flour (cake flour preferably)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, & more for coating pan
- 2 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs, room temperature

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to **350 degrees**. Butter two 9-by-2-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper. Butter the parchment, and dust with cocoa powder; tap out excess.
2. Sift cocoa; whisk in boiling coffee and milk. Let cool. Sift together cake flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add sugar and vanilla. Add the egg one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Pour in the cooled cocoa mixture. Mix until fully incorporated.
4. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, stirring until just combined.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pans (about 4 cup in each pan). Bake for 20 minutes, rotate the pans, and bake for an additional 15 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean when inserted into the center.
6. Remove cakes from the oven, and allow to cool in pans for 15 minutes on a cooling rack. Carefully run a small offset spatula around the edge of the cakes to loosen them from the pan. Remove cakes from pans, and invert on a wire rack. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.
7. To assemble, using a serrated knife, level the top surface of each cake layer. Place four strips of parchment paper around the perimeter of the cake stand. Spread with 3/4 cup chocolate frosting. Top with remaining layer, bottom side up. Using a swirling motion, cover the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting.
