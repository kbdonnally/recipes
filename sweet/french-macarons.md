- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cook time: 14 minutes
- Additional time: 30 minutes
- Total time: 1hr 4 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 4oz (115g) ground almonds
- 8oz (230g) icing sugar
- 5oz (144g) egg whites (separated, covered in plastic wrap and left at room temperature for a few hours)
- 2.5oz (72g) granulated sugar
- Optional: food coloring powder - about 2 teaspoons for this amount of macarons

## Directions:

1. Make sure egg whites are at room temperature.
2. Line two baking trays with parchment paper.
3. Prepare a 14" piping bag with plain tip, twist the bag at the top end and place inside a glass to facilitate filling the bag.
4. Combine almond flour and powdered sugar (and freeze-dried fruit or cocoa powder) in a food processer, pulsing about 10 times for a few seconds until all ingredient are thoroughly incorporated.
5. Sift dry ingredients twice using a fine sieve and pressing the mixture through your hands and set aside.
6. Using a stand mixer, beat the egg whites and sugar at a low speed (KitchenAid 4) for 2 minutes, medium speed (KitchenAid 6) for 2 minutes and a high speed (KitchenAid 8) for 2 minutes. The egg whites will be a large mass at this point; don't worry!
7. Add the coloring powder and mix for one minute at the highest speed (KitchenAid 10).
8. Add the dry ingredients to the egg whites. You can do this all at once - don't be shy!
9. Fold the mixture at the same time pressing it against the sides of the bowl to deflate the mixture. Fold this mixture about 40 times (counting single strokes), stopping every couple of strokes after 25 to check the consistency. It should be lava-like, flowing in ribbons off the spatula.
10. Transfer the mixture to the piping bag, sealing the open end with a twist and holding firmly with the hand that will not be actively piping.
11. Pipe 4 tiny dots under the corners of the parchment paper to make sure it stays put.
12. Pipe your macarons, holding the piping tip at an angle to the baking sheet, about 3cm in diameter (they will spread during cooking), and quickly removing the tip when you have finished piping, making a shape like a comma. Rap the tray four times on each side hard on a countertop to remove any remaining air bubbles.
13. **Rest** the tray of macaron shells for about 30 minutes before baking. At this point you should pre-heat the oven to 300 degrees F.
14. Place the tray of macarons on an empty baking tray and bake for 14 to 18 minutes at 300 degrees F, turning the tray from back to front halfway through.
15. Remove from oven and let the tray sit for a few minutes.
16. Remove the parchment from the tray and place on a cooling rack and allow the macarons to cool completely. Remove from parchment paper.
17. Pair up like shells to facilitate the filling process.
18. Once completely cool, fill with ganache or filling of your choice.
19. Best enjoyed 24 hours after filling.

*Source: [The Best Swiss Meringue Buttercream for Macarons, Cakes and More](https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/the-best-swiss-meringue-buttercream-for-macarons-cakes-321-ratio/)*

Total time: 30 minutes

Note: 3:2:1 ratio applies here. Three parts butter, 2 parts sugar, 1 part egg whites.

## Ingredients:

- 65 grams egg whites
- 130 grams granulated sugar
- 195 grams butter at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or any other flavoring, added to taste)

## Directions:

1. Set butter out at room temperature.
2. Bring a small pot of water to a boil.
3. Place egg white and sugar into a heat proof bowl. Stainless steal is light and safe.
4. Gently whisk the whites and sugar mix over the boiling water.
5. Pay attention to whisking the mixture when it starts getting hot, you don't want to cook the eggs.
6. Whisk the mixture until the temperature reaches 160F.
7. Pour the mixture into the KitchenAid mixer with the balloon whisk attached. Whip on low to start, then increase to medium.
8. Once the mixture is stiff and the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch, stop mixer. Change the whisk attachment to the paddle attachment.
9. Add butter a little bit at a time while beating with the paddle attachment on medium speed.
10. The mixture might look curdled or separated for a while but keep mixing. It will all come together.
11. Add any extract, flavorings or food coloring if desired. Whip until incorporated.
12. Using a flexible spatula, fold out excess air in the frosting so that it can be piped or spread smoothly.
13. Use immediately.
