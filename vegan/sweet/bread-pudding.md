# Vegan Bread Pudding

## Ingredients

### Bread pudding:

- 1 lb stale bread in cubes 
- 3 cups non-dairy milk (ideally soy)
- 3/4 cup sugar (I use 1/2 cup)
- 1/4 ground flax seeds
- 2-3 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 ground cinnamon

### Whiskey sauce:

- 3-4 tbs butter
- Powdered sugar
- Maple syrup
- Whiskey

## Directions

### Bread pudding:

1. Place bread in greased baking dish (9x9)
2. Whisk together other ingredients.
3. Pour mixture over bread; smush around and set aside for a bit.
4. Preheat oven to **350 degrees**.
5. Place 9x9 dish in oven and bake for **60 to 70 minutes**.
6. Remove and allow to cool.

### Whiskey sauce:

1. Melt butter in saucepan.
2. Turn off heat; add powdered sugar to make thick paste. Stiffer than sugar cookie icing; less stiff than buttercream. 
3. Stir with whisk to try to eliminate all lumps.
4. Add a couple tablespoons of maple syrup and whisk. Turn heat back on. The consistency should ribbon off of the whisk or spoon when dipped into mixture. Approximately sugar cookie icing consistency.
5. Let it boil a bit, about 30 seconds.
6. Stir to let it cool a tad. Should be approximately the thickness of honey.
7. Add whiskey. First adding will totally evaporate. Add more and it'll boil that off too. Stir and then add last splash of whiskey, which will retain its kick.
8. Serve over bread pudding!
