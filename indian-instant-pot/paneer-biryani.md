*Timing:*

- Prep time: 10 minutes
- Sauté: 3 minutes
- Manual: 5 minutes, high pressure
- Release: natural

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons ghee or peanut oil
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons minced ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 2 jalapeños, diced
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup paneer, cut into cubes
- 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 6 to 8 fresh mint sprigs, finely chopped
- 1 cup basmati rice, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup water

## Directions

1. Preheat the Instant Pot by selecting Sauté and adjusting to More for high heat. When the inner cooking pot is hot, add the ghee, and heat until it is shimmering. Add the onion and cook until well-browned. Add the ginger, garlic, and jalapeños, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Add the garam masala and salt, and mix well. Keep in mint that you'll need enough salt to flavor the rice.
3. Add the paneer and frozen vegetables, and spread them out to cover the bottom of the pot. Sprinkle the chopped cilantro and mint on top.
4. Spread the rinsed, drained rice across everything. Do not stir.
5. Pour in the water and gently push the rice down so it is mostly covered by the water.
6. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 5 minutes. 
7. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Unlock the lid.
8. Open and inhale deeply! Enjoy the true-to-tradition aroma of this dish, and then either mix it gently from the bottom, or serve it by scooping up a layer from top to bottom so you include the paneer, vegetables, herbs, and rice in every serving.
