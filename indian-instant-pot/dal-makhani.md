Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup whole black urad dal
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
- 2 teaspoons minced ginger
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup half-and-half or cream, (or a nondairy milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 2 teaspoons Ghee
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

## Ingredients

1. Rinse the dal well and transfer it to the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot. Add the bay leaves, garlic, ginger, and water.
2. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 30 minutes. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally.
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, half-and-half, salt, turmeric, cayenne, cumin, coriander, and Garam Masala. Mix thoroughly and set aside.
4. When the dal is ready, unlock and remove the lid. Using the back of a spoon, gently mash some of the dal to make a thicker texture, leaving most of it intact. 
5. Select the Warm setting.
6. In a small saucepan, heat the ghee over medium heat until it shimmers, and add the cumin seeds, which will start to sputter. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it absorbs all the ghee, about 2 minutes.
7. Pour this paste into the dal and mix well.
8. Add the yogurt mixture and mix well. Serve with the chopped cilantro (if using).
