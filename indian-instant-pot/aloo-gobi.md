Serves: 4

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon peanut oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 cups sliced potatoes, about 1/4 inch thick
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin

- 1/4 cup water
- 4 cups large cauliflower florets, about 1 medium cauliflower
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the Instant Pot by selecting Sauté and adjust to more for high heat. When the inner cooking pot is hot, add the oil and heat until shimmering. Add the cumin seeds and stir. They'll sputter like popcorn popping.
2. Add the potatoes and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they begin to brown and crisp a little.
3. Add the salt, Garam masala, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cayenne, and sauté for 1 minute. Add the tomato and water, and stir, scraping up all the lovely font on the bottom of the pot. Add the cauliflower and stir gently.
4. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to Low. Cook for 2 minutes.
5. When the cooking is complete, quick-release the pressure. Unlock the lid.
6. Garnish with the chopped cilantro (if using).
