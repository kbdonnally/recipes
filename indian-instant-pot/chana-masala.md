- Prep time: 10 minutes

- Sauté: 3 minutes

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried chickpeas
- 2 to 3 bay leaves
- 3 cups water
- 1 tablespoon Ghee
- 1/3 cup Onion Masala
- 2 teaspoons ready-made chana masala powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

1. In the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot, combine the chickpeas, bay leaves, and water.
2. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 18 minutes. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Unlock the lid.
3. Carefully remove the lid and drain the chickpeas, reserving the cooking water. Transfer the chickpeas to a medium bowl. 
4. Using a potato masher, roughly mash about half the chickpeas. This will thicken the final sauce. Set aside.
5. Rinse and dry the inner cooking pot. Replace it in the Instant Pot.
6. Preheat the Instant Pot by selecting Sauté and adjust to More for high heat. When the pot is hot, add the ghee. When it is shimmering, add the onion masala. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until the masala is heated through, then add the chana masala powder and salt. Mix well.
7. Add the chickpeas and enough of the cooking water to achieve the consistency of oatmeal, and heat through.
8. Stir in the lemon juice.
9. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice, naan, or chapatis.
