## Ingredients

- 1 (14 oz) can diced tomatoes (do not drain)
- 5-6 garlic cloves, diced
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 2 teaspoons garam masala, divided
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken (breasts or thighs)
- 4 oz butter, cut into cubes, or 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream or full-fat coconut milk (/cream)
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

1. In the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot, add the tomatoes, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, 1 teaspoon garam masala, cumin, and salt. Mix thoroughly, then place the chicken pieces on top of the sauce
2. Lock the lid into place. Select manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 10 minutes.
3. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Unlock the lid. Carefully remove the chicken and set aside.
4. Using an immersion blender in the pot, blend together all the ingredients into a smooth sauce. Let the sauce cool for several minutes. 
5. Add the butter cubes, cream, remaining 1 teaspoon of garam masala, and cilantro. Stir until well-incorporated. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon when you're done.
6. Remove half of the sauce and freeze it for later, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.
7. Add the chicken back to the sauce. Preheat the instant pot by selecting Sauté and adjust to Less for low heat. Let the chicken heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you like, but don't shred it.
8. Serve over rice or raw cucumber noodles.
