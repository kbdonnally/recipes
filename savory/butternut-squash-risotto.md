# Butternut Squash Risotto

## Ingredients:

- 7 cups chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 4 cups cubed butternut squash
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups Arborio rice
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 cup Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons freshly chopped sage

## Directions:

1. In medium saucepan over medium heat, bring chicken broth to simmer. Reduce heat to low.
2. In large pot, heat oil. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften; about 5 minutes. Stir in squash, 1 tablespoon butter, and garlic. Cook until the squash is beginning to color around the edges and then soft, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Stir in remaining tablespoon of butter and Arborio rice, stirring quickly. Cook until the grains are well-coated and smell slightly toasty, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook until the wine has mostly absorbed.
4. With a ladle, add about 1 cup hot broth. Stirring often, cook until the rice has mostly absorbed liquid. Add remaining broth about 1 cup at a time, continuing to allow the rice to absorb each addition of broth before adding more.
5. Stir often and cook until squash is tender and risotto is al dente and creamy - not mushy! - about 25 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and sage, then season with salt and pepper before serving.
