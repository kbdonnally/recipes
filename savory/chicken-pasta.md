# Chicken Pasta

## Ingredients:

- ~3 bell peppers (orange, yellow, & red)
- 1/2 garlic clove, crushed
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 tbs butter
- 2 tbs flour
- 1 cup milk
- Rotel tomatoes
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Shredded Parmesan cheese to top off (optional)
- Salt & pepper
- 1 package linguine fini (or linguine or spaghetti)
- 1/2 reserved cup of pasta water

## Directions:

1. Salt pasta cooking water and heat. While heating, slice peppers. If not all peppers are sliced by time of boil, turn heat down while you finish.
2. In large saute pan, add bit of olive oil. Turn burner to medium-high or high. Heat up oil a bit. (Goal isn't to cook the peppers, it's to warm them and brown them a bit.) *Note: you can saut√© an onion here, too!*
3. Toss in peppers and crushed garlic. No lid because texture of peppers will change and you want them to still have a crunch. Stir frequently.
4. Remove peppers from stove to prevent from cooking further. *Put them on a paper plate if you want to use the same pan for making the sauce.*
5. Turn burner under the pasta pot to high and finish bringing water to rolling boil.
6. In same pan, start the roux. Add bbutter to melt and llower heat setting to low. Sprinkle flour over butter and stir/whisk into paste with no lumps. At first, should look creamy. Continue stirring until takes on a granular characteristic, which is the sign that the flower has been cooked and has absorbed the butter.
7. While roux is cooking, add pasta to boilig water and stir so noodles don't clump. Set pasta timer and stir intermittently.
8. Slowly add 1/2 cup milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. May need to raise burner temperature slightly, especially if you're adding cold milk. When the milk mixture is very smooth, whisk in the rest of the milk.
9. Cook and thicken milk sauce. It may take 3-5 minutes to thicken the milk sauce. Cook on low (plus a smidge), stirrinig frequently to let the starch in the flour absorb the liquid, which is how the sauce thickens.
10. Add Rotel tomatoes and stir well.
11. Add grated Parmesan cheese. Stir to incorporate and let gently simmer a minute or two. Taste sauce to see if it needs pepper or more parmesan cheese. Shouldn't need salt due to the cheese.
12. If pan is large enough, add peppers to the sauce and stir to evenly distribute. Turn burner off, but keep sauce on the stove.
13. Pasta timer should be going off. Before draining pasta, ladle out some pasta water (approximately 1/2 to 1 cup). Drain pasta.
14. If pan with sauce was big enough to add the peppers, skip this. If not, put them in the bottom of the empty pasta paot before next step. The hot pasta ensures they'll be reheated immediately.
15. Return pasta to stock pot. Put all components in pot: pasta, peppers, and sauce into the pot and mix thoroughly.
16. (Optional) If want to bake with Parmesan cheese on top, place in oven-safe casserole dish and top with shredded Parmesan, then bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes.
