# Mahi Mahi Testing

*Testing and combining different mahi recipes.*

First: [Coconut-Mango Mahi Mahi](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/coconut-mango-mahi-mahi/)

This does everything I want in the recipe, but the fish is seared rather than baked, which I would prefer. 

Second: a yummy sounding recipe, but doesnâ€™t meet my coconut/mango requirements. Link: [Parmesan Crusted Baked Mahi Mahi - Will Cook For Smiles](https://www.willcookforsmiles.com/parmesan-crusted-baked-mahi-mahi/)

Try both and see how it goes! (Oven bake the fish in the coconut one.)
