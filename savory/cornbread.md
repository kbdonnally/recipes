- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/4 cups buttermilk

2. Combine dry ingredients except for baking *soda* in a bowl.
3. In another bowl, mix buttermilk and baking soda. Set aside.
4. In a small bowl, beat the egg with the sugar until combined.
5. Add the oil and mix until combined.
6. Pour this mixture into the buttermilk/baking soda and mix.
7. When oven is preheated, toss the butter into skillet and let it melt.
8. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix in as few strokes as it takes to just make the dough come together.
9. Pull the skillet out of the oven, swirling to get the butter covering the bottom and up the sides of the pan.

11. Turn out onto a cutting board, cut into wedges, and serve.
