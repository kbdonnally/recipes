# Oven Bacon

## Ingredients:

- Bacon
- Cookie sheet

## Directions:

1. Arrange the bacon slices on a sheet pan and place the pan on the center rack of a **cold oven** (important!). (Try not to stretch the slices out. Just gently drape the bacon across the pan.) Close the oven door. Turn the oven on to **400 degrees F**. Walk away.
2. Come back **17 to 20 minutes** later. As soon as the bacon is golden brown, but not excessively crip, it's done. The exact time will depen on the thickness of the bacon slices and how quickly your oven reaches the target temperature.
3. Remove tthe pan from the oven. Transfer the bacon to a second sheet pan (or a plate or dish) lined with paper towels to absorb any excess fat.

*Reminder: keep your eye on the bacon during the final few minutes of cooking to make sure that it doesn't burn. Remove the cooked bacon from the hot pan right away. If you leave it in the pan too long, the heat from the pan and the hot bacon fat will continue cooking it.*
