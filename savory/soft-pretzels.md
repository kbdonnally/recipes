# Soft Pretzels 

## Ingredients:

- 2 cups milk
- 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast (2 packets)
- 6 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons butter (room temperature)
- 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/3 cup baking soda
- 3 cups warm water
- Coarse salt (to taste)
- 6 tablespoons butter, melted

## Directions:

1. Warm milk in microwave safe bowl in microwave (or stove if you prefer) until temperature of milk reaches 110 degrees, or about 1 1/2 to 2 mins on high power.
2. Pour milk along with yeasat into the bowl of an electric stand mixer and whisk together until yeast has dissolved; let rest 5 minutes. Add brown sugar, 4 tablespoons softened butter, 1 cup of flour and 2 teaspoons fine sea salt to milk mixture and using the whisk attachment, stir until blended.
3. Switch attachment to a dough hook, add remaining 3 1/2 cups flour and kneaded mixture on medium low speed until elastic.
4. Mix in up to an additional 1/2 cup flour, as needed, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to **450 degrees**. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper (alternately you could grease them). Punch dough down several times to release any air pockets.
6. Divide dough into 12 equal pices and cover loosely with plastic wrap.
7. Roll each piece out into a long, thin rope about 32-36 inches long. Form dough rope into a pretzel shape.
8. In a shallow bowl, whisk together baking soda and warm water, then fully immerse pretzel into water mixture, lift and allow excess water to drip off.
9. Place on prepared baking sheet, reshape as needed and sprinkle to taste with coarse salt. Repeat this process with remaining dough.
10. Bake pretzels in preheated oven **7-11 minutes** until golden brown (note that you will likely only be able to cook 6 at a time among the two baking sheets). Remove from oven and brush top and bottom of pretzels with melted butter.
