# Red Beet, Goat Cheese, & Walnut Salad

## Ingredients

- 4 medium red beets
- 6 oz (4 cups) baby arugula 
- 1/4 cup reduced-fat balsamic vinaigrette (e.g. Ken's light options)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
- Salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 oz (1/2 cup) crumbled goat cheese
- 1/4 cup walnuts, toasted

## Directions

1. Prick the skin of the beets with a fork. Place beets on microwave-safe plate and microwave on high until tender (about 12 minutes). Alternatively, wrap beets in foil and roast in oven for 1 hour at 375 degrees. When they're cool enough to handle, peel the beets and cut into bite-size wedges.
2. In large bowl, combine beets, arugula, vinaigrette, parsley, and chives. Toss thoroughly to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Divide the salad among 4 plates. Top each salad with crumbled goat cheese and toasted walnuts, and serve.
