# Chicken Tenders with Ranch Dressing

## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 1/2 cups whole wheat panko crumbs, e.g. Ian's All-Natural
- 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, e.g. Spice Hunter
- 4 large egg whites
- 8 oz (about 8) chicken tenders
- Salt and pepper
- Cooking spray
- 3 teaspoons ranch salad dressing and seasoning mix, e.g. Hidden Valley
- 6 tablespoons (about 3 oz) reduced-fat sour cream, e.g. Breakstone's
- 6 tablespoons (about 3 oz) low-fat buttermilk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place wire rack on foil-lined baking sheet and set aside.
2. Put flower in shallow dish. Mix panko and poultry seasoning together in another shallow dish. In a medium bowl, whip the egg whites with a whisk until they are extremely foamy, but not quite holding peaks.
3. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Working in batches, dredge the chicken tenders in the flower, shaking off any excess. Add the chicken to the egg whites and toss to coat them completely. Add the chicken, a few pieces at a time, to the bowl of panko and coat completely.
4. Spread the chicken out on the wire rack. Season the chicken well with salt and pepper, and spray lightly with cooking spray. Bake the tenders until the breading is golden and crispy and the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, in small bowl, mix salad dressing mix with sour cream and buttermilk.
6. Serve the chicken tenders with the salad dressing.
