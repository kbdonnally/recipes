## Ingredients

- 1 cup low-fat, low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons currants

## Directions

1. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, remove from stove to coat it with cooking spray.
2. Season the salmon fillets on both sides with salt and pepper to taste. Lay the fillets on the hot grill pan and cook, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer salmon to serving platter, and tent it with foil to keep it warm.
