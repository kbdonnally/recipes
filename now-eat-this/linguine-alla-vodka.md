# Spicy-Sweet Linguine alla Vodka

## Ingredients

- 8 oz whole wheat linguine
- 1 1/2 cups low-fat marinara sauce
- 1 large bottle fire-roasted red peppers (about 4 oz), cut into thin strips (approximately 3/4 cup)
- 1/4 cup 2% Greek yogurt, e.g. Fage Total
- 1 cup chopped fresh basil
- 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce
- Salt and pepper
- 6 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Directions

1. Bring pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions (approximately 9 minutes).
2. Meanwhile, bring marinara sauce and sliced peppers to a simmer in large nonstick saut√© pan over medium heat. Cook the sauce, stirring it occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until it is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove sauce from heat.
3. Put yogurt in small bowl. Stir about 1/2 cup of warmed sauce into the yogurt until smooth (for tempering, to prevent yogurt from curdling). Then, whisk yogurt mixture into marinara sauce. Keep sauce off heat, and cover pan to keep sauce warm.
4. Drain linguine. Put in large serving bowl, and add sauce, basil, and 1 teaspoon of hot pepper sauce. TOS gently until linguine is evenly coated with sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and if preferred, additional hot pepper sauce. Sprinkle cheese on top, and serve.
