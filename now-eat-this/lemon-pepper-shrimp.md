# Lemon Pepper Shrimp

*With a side of broccoli rabe.*

## Ingredients

- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed
- 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup hot pepper jelly (e.g. Stonewall Kitchen)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 bunch broccoli rabe

## Directions

1. Heat a large nonstick sauté pan over medium-high heat.
2. Blot the shrimp with paper towels to ensure they are dry. Season one side of the shrimp with salt to taste. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the pepper onto one side of the shrimp and lightly press so pepper adheres. Repeat on other side with remaining pepper.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then add the shrimp, salted side down. After about 2 minutes, season the other side with salt and turn the shrimp over. Transfer shrimp to a plate and set aside.
4. Turn off heat, and while pan is still hot, add the lemon juice, pepper jelly, and butter. Stir until well-mixed. Toss shrimp back into pan and coat in sauce. Set aside.
5. Heat another large nonstick sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add remaining oil and garlic. Add the broccoli rabe and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
