# Pita Chips with Charred Eggplant Dip

## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant
- 1/3 cup cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 garlic clove, coarsely chopped
- 5 teaspoons lemon juice
- Pinch of cumin
- Salt and pepper
- 3 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
- 4 oz baked pita chips, e.g. 365 Everyday Value

## Directions

1. Place eggplant on grate of gas burner over high flame. Char the eggplant, turning it every few minutes, until the skin is blackened and the flesh is cooked through; this should take about 12 minutes. (Alternatively, you can char the eggplant on a barbecue grill, on a grill pan, or on a baking chest until the broiler of an oven.) Allow the eggplant to cool slightly, and then cut it in half. Scrape out the flesh, being careful not to incorporate the blackened skin, into the bowl of a food processor. 
2. Add the beans, garlic, lemon juice, and cumin to the food processor bowl. Pur√©e until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Transfer mixture to serving bowl. Sprinkle parsley over the mixture and serve with pita chips.
