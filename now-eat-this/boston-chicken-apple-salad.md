## Directions

1. Heat grill pan over high heat
2. Spray chicken lightly with cooking spray, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook chicken until it is just cooked through; about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter, and cover with foil to keep it warm. 
3. In large bowl, combine the lettuce, apples, blue cheese, and vinaigrette. Toss until apples and lettuce are coated with dressing. Transfer to serving bowl.
