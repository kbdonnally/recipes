# Sheet Pan Pesto Chicken with Crispy Garlic Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 12 oz small red potatoes (3 or 4 potatoes)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (8 oz) boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 3 tablespoons prepared pesto

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and set rack to bottom position. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. (Not foil! It'll stick.)
2. Scrub the potatoes and dry them well, then dice into 1 inch pieces.
3. In medium bowl, combine the potatoes, olive oil, salt, and garlic powder. Toss well to coat.
4. Place the potatoes on the parchment paper and roast for 10 minutes. Flip the potatoes and return to oven for another 10 minutes.
5. While potatoes are roasting, place the chicken in the same bowl and toss with the pesto, coating the chicken evenly.
6. Check the potatoes to make sure they are golden brown on the top and bottom. Toss them again and add the chicken breast to the pan.
7. Turn the heat down to 350 degrees and let the chicken and potatoes roast for 30 minutes. Check to make sure the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F and the potatoes are tender inside.
