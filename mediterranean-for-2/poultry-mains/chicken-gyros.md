# Chicken Gyros with Grilled Vegetables and Tzatziki Sauce

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus extra for oiling the grill
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano, or 1/2 teaspoon dry oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided, plus more to season vegetables
- 8 oz chicken tenders
- 1 small zucchini, cut into 1/2 inch strips lengthwise
- 1 small eggplant, cut into 1 inch strips lengthwise
- 1/2 red pepper, seeded and cut in half lengthwise
- 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill
- 2 (8 inch) pita breads

## Directions

1. In medium bowl, combine the lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the oregano, garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the chicken and marinate 30 minutes.
2. Place the zucchini, eggplant, and red pepper in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle liberally with salt and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Toss them well to coat. Let the vegetables rest while the chicken is marinating.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, cucumber, the remaining salt, and the dill. Stir well to combine and set aside in the refrigerator.
4. When ready to grill, heat the grill to medium-high (350-400 degrees F) and oil the grill grate.
5. Drain any liquid from the vegetables and place them on the grill. Remove chicken tenders from the marinade and place them on the grill.
6. Cook chicken and vegetables 3 minutes per side, or until the chicken is no longer pink inside and the vegetables have grill marks.
7. Remove the chicken and vegetables from the grill and set aside. On the grill, heat the pitas for about 30 seconds, flipping them frequently so they don't burn.
8. Divide the chicken tenders and vegetables between the pitas and top each with 1/4 cup of the tzatziki sauce. Roll the pitas up like a cone to eat.
