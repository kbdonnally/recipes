# Greek Yogurt-Marinated Chicken

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano (or 1 tablespoon dried oregano)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 (4 oz) boneless, skinless chicken breasts

## Directions

1. In medium bowl, add the yogurt, garlic,, oregano, lemon zest, olive oil, and salt and stir to combine. If the yogurt is very thick, you may need to add a few tablespoons of water or a squeeze of lemon juice to thin it a bit.
2. Add the chicken to the bowl and toss it in the marinade to coat it well. Cover and refrigerate chicken for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
3. Place chicken in baking dish and roast for 30 minutes, or until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
