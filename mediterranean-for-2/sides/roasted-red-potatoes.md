# Crispy Roasted Red Potatoes with Garlic, Rosemary, and Parmesan

## Ingredients

- 12 oz red potatoes (3 to 4 small potatoes)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary (from 1 sprig)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and set the rack to the bottom position. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (foil will stick).
2. Scrub the potatoes and dry them well. Dice into 1 inch pieces.
3. In mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, olive oil, garlic powder, and salt. Toss well to coat.
4. Lay the potatoes on the parchment paper and roast for 10 minutes. Flip potatoes over and return to the oven for 10 more minutes.
5. Check the potatoes to make sure they are golden brown on the top and bottom. Toss them again, turn the heat down to 350 degrees F, and roast for 30 minutes more.
6. When the potatoes are golden, crispy, and cooked through, sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over them and toss again. Return to the oven for 3 minutes to let the cheese melt a bit.
7. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the fresh rosemary.
