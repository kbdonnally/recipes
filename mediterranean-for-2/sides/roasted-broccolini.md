# Roasted Broccolini with Garlic and Romano

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch broccolini (about 5 oz)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated Romano cheese

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and set the oven rack to the middle position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
2. Slice the tough ends off the broccolini and place in a medium bowl. Add the olive oil, garlic powder, and salt and toss to combine. Arrange broccolini on the lined sheet pan.
3. Roast for 7 minutes, flipping pieces over halfway through the roasting time.
4. Remove pan from oven and sprinkle cheese over the broccolini. With a pair of tongs, carefully flip the pieces over to coat all sides. Return to the oven for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until cheese melts and starts to turn golden.
