# Roasted Cauliflower with Lemon Tahini Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1/2 large head cauliflower, stemmed and broken into florets (about 3 cups)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon harissa paste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and set the rack to the lowest position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
2. Toss the cauliflower florets with the olive oil in a large bowl and transfer to the sheet pan. Reserve the bowl to make the tahini sauce.
3. Roast the cauliflower for 15 minutes, turning it once or twice, until it starts to turn golden.
4. In the same bowl, combine the tahini, lemon juice, harissa, and salt.
5. When the cauliflower is tender, remove it from oven and toss with the tahini sauce. Return to the sheet pan and roast for 5 minutes more.
