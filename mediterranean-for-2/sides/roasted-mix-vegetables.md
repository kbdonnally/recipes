# Lemon-Thyme Roasted Mixed Vegetables

## Ingredients

- 1 head garlic, cloves split apart, unpeeled
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 medium carrots
- 1/4 pound asparagus
- 6 Brussels sprouts
- 2 cups cauliflower florets
- 1/2 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
- 1/2 fresh lemon, sliced
- Salt and pepper
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- Freshly squeezed lemon juice

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and set rack to middle position. Line sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
2. Place the garlic cloves in a small piece of foil and wrap lightly to enclose them, but don't seal the package. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place the foiled packet on the sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes while you prepare the remaining vegetables.
3. While garlic is roasting, clean, peel, and trim vegetables: Cut carrots into strips, 1/2 inch wide and 3-4 inches long; snap tough ends off asparagus; trim tough ends off the Brussels sprouts and cut in half if they are large; trim the cauliflower into 2 inch florets; keep tomatoes whole. The vegetables should be cut into pieces of similar sizes for even roasting.
4. Place all vegetables and the lemon slices into a large mixing bowl. Drizzle generously with the 5 remaining teaspoons of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.
5. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F.
6. Arrange vegetables on the sheet pan in a single layer, leaving the packet of garlic cloves on the pan. Roast for 20 minutes, turning occasionally until tender. 
7. When the vegetables are tender, remove from oven and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Let the garlic cloves sit until cool enough to handle, then remove the skins. Leave them whole, or gently mash.
8. Toss garlic with vegetables and an additional squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
