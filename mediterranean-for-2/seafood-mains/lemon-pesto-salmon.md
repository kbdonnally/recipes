# Lemon Pesto Salmon

## Ingredients

- 10 oz salmon fillet (1 large piece or 2 smaller ones)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons prepared pesto sauce
- 1 large fresh lemon, sliced

## Directions

1. Oil the grill grate and heat the grill to medium-high heat. Alternatively, you can roast the salmon in a 350 degree F oven.
2. Prepare the salmon by seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then spread the pesto sauce on top.
3. Make a bed of fresh lemon slices about the same size as your fillet on the hot grill (or on a baking sheet if roasting), and rest the salmon on top of the lemon slices. Place any additional lemon slices on top of the salmon.
4. Grill the salmon for 6 to 10 minutes, or until it's opaque and flakes apart easily. If roasting, it will take about 20 minutes. There is no need to flip the fish over.
