# Asparagus and Mushroom Farroto

*Using farro instead of Arborio rice. It is cooked much the same way.*

## Ingredients

- 1/2 oz dried porcini mushrooms
- 1 cup hot water
- 3 cups low-sodium vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 large onion, minced (1 cup)
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 cup diced mushrooms (about 4 oz)
- 3/4 cup farro
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 oz asparagus, cut into 1/2 inch pieces (about 1 cup)
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt

## Directions

1. Soak the dried mushrooms in the hot water for about 15 minutes. When softened, drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid. (Strain through a coffee filter in case there's any grit.) Minch porcini mushrooms.
2. Add mushroom Iquitos and vegetable stock to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low just to keep it warm.
3. Heat olive oil in Dutch oven over high heat. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms, and sauté for 10 minutes.
4. Add the farro to the Dutch oven and sauté it for 3 minutes to toast.
5. Add the wine, thyme, and one ladleful of the hot mushroom and chicken stock. Bring to boil while stirring the farro. Do not cover the pot while the farro is cooking.
6. Reduce heat to medium. When liquid is absorbed, add another ladleful or two at a time to the pot, stirring occasionally until the farro is cooked through. Keep an eye on the heat, to make sure it doesn't cook too quickly.
7. When farro is al dente, add the asparagus and another ladleful of stock. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until the asparagus is softened.
8. Stir in Parmesan cheese and season with salt.
