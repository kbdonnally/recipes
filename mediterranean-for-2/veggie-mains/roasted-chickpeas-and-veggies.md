# Sheet Pan Roasted Chickpeas and Vegetables with Harissa Yogurt

## Ingredients

- 4 cups cauliflower florets (about 1/2 small head)
- 2 medium carrots, peeled, halved, and then sliced into quarters lengthwise
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons za'atar spice mix, divided
- 1 (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and patted dry
- 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon harissa spice paste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and set the rack to the middle position. Line a sheet pan with foil or parchment paper.
2. Place cauliflower and carrots in large bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of za'atar. Toss well to combine.
3. Spread the vegetables onto one half of the sheet pan in a single layer.
4. Place the chickpeas in the same bowl and season with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the remaining za'atar. Toss well to combine.
5. Spread chickpeas onto other half of sheet pan.
6. Roast for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the chickpeas start to turn golden. Flip the vegetables halfway through cooking time, and give chickpeas a stir so they cook evenly.
7. Chickpeas may need a few extra minutes if you like them crispy. If so, remove the vegetables and leave the chickpeas in until they're cooked to desired crispiness. 
8. While the vegetables are roasting, combine the yogurt and harissa in small bowl. Taste, and add additional harissa as desired.
