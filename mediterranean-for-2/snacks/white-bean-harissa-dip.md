# White Bean Harissa Dip

## Ingredients

- 1 whole head of garlic
- 1/2 cup olive oil, divided
- 1 (15 oz) can of cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon harissa paste (or more to taste)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cut about 1/4 inch off the top of a whole head of garlic and lightly wrap it in foil. Drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil over top of the cut side. Place it in an oven-safe dish and roast it in the oven for about an hour or until the cloves are soft and tender.
3. Remove garlic from oven and let cool. (Can be roasted up to 2 days ahead of time.)
4. Remove garlic cloves from their skin and place them in the bowl of a food processor along with the beans, salt, and harissa. Pur√©e, drizzling in as much olive oil as needed until beans are smooth. If the dip seems too stiff, add additional olive oil to loosen the dip.
5. Taste dip and add additional salt, harissa, or oil as needed.
6. Store in refrigerator for up to a week.
7. Portion out 1/4 cup of dip and serve with mixture of raw veggies and mini pita breads.
